1. What did I accomplish yesterday?

Set up a Spring Boot application integrated with Google People API.

Enabled People API and Contacts API in Google Cloud Console.

Created OAuth 2.0 credentials with redirect URI for local testing.

Configured the application.yml file with required OAuth scopes and endpoints.

Successfully authenticated with Google and fetched contact data.

2. What will I do today?

Finalize contact CRUD functionality (create, update, delete).

Test UI interactions such as adding, editing, and deleting contacts via modal forms.

Ensure search and table updates work in real-time.

Write final documentation and prepare project for submission.

3. Any blockers or challenges?

Making sure both People API and Contacts API are enabled (common cause of 403 errors).

Correctly configuring the redirect URI and environment variables for OAuth.

Ensuring that contact changes are synchronized with Googleâ€™s servers without delay.
